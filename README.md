* A example of a simple searchbox. Made for somebody else to use in his project SO there is no context or methods to retrieve data from database.

* * First time working with vue!
* * The searchbox uses VUEX to get and store states.
* * Main functionality: when a select is changed, the underlying selects clear themselves.# vue_searchbox_example
